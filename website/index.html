    <h1>Kosli Homework Site</h1>
    <p>This is a very simple website, containing just some HTML and image files.</p>

    <h2>Dev Container</h2>
    <img src="./docker-icon.png" width="50em"/>
    <p>Putting a development environment within a container allows me to
       isolate my dependencies, and not worry about what packages are already
       installed on my laptop.</p>
    <p>A dev container allows me to to experiment with upgrades - if things
       don't work out, I can quickly undo and go back to a known good state.
       Without a dev container, downgrading things can be hit and miss</p>

    <h2>Makefiles</h2>
    <p>Splitting the content of the Makefile into smaller files, makes each part
       easier to reason about.</p>
